🔐 Random Password Generator (Python)

A simple Python-based command-line tool that generates strong and secure random passwords based on user-defined preferences such as length and character types (letters, numbers, and symbols).

The project helps beginners understand randomization, user input handling, and character set management, while also being expandable into an advanced GUI-based password generator with additional security features.

Features:

Custom password length

Option to include letters, numbers, and symbols

Secure and randomized password generation

Easy to extend with GUI and clipboard support

This project is part of the OIBSIP Internship Program and demonstrates practical Python programming and security concepts.
